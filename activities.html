Here's some of the things I've done in various student organizations.

<h1> Illini Solar Car </h1>
<p>
I have been on the Illini Solar Car team since September 2018. For the most part, I have contributed to testing efforts for different components of the solar car.

I was an Electrical group lead from August to December of 2019. I am currently working on the software architecture of the car's Motor Controller Controller.

<h1> Student Space Systems </h1>
I have worked on the flight computer for Student Space Systems since I joined in September 2018, primarily on the data logging components. I am currently the project manager for the flight computer group.
