Here's some of the things I've done in various student organizations.

<h1> Illini Solar Car </h1>
<p>
I worked with Illini Solar Car from 2018 to 2019. For the most part, I have contributed to testing efforts for different components of the solar car.

I was an Electrical group lead from August to December of 2019 and helped revise the Motor Controller Controller system.

<h1> Student Space Systems </h1>
I have worked on the flight computer for Student Space Systems from 2018 to 2020 (when the club disbanded), 
primarily on the data logging components.
